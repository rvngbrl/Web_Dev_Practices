                    <li>White Egg</li>
                    <li>Quail Egg</li>
                </ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        </ul> 

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, melted butter, salt, and eggs to the yeast mixture. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle (about 16x12 inches).</li>
            <li>Spread the softened butter over the rolled-out dough.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the buttered dough.</li>
            <li>Starting from the long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Cut the log into 12 equal slices.</li>
            <li>Place the slices in a greased baking dish, leaving some space between each roll. Cover with a damp cloth and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving. Optionally, you can drizzle icing over the warm rolls.</li>
        </ol>
